## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 9.0.0

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/HienPham2022/QA_Automation_Challenge_HienPhamVan.git
cd QA_Automation_Challenge_HienPhamVan

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

---

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run ALL tests (headless - fast)
npm test

# Run with browser visible (demo/debug)
npm run test:headed
```

### Run by Feature Tag (Headless)

```bash
# Login feature tests (58 tests)
npm run test:login

# Cart feature tests (51 tests)
npm run test:cart

# E2E purchase flow tests (9 tests)
npm run test:e2e

# Smoke tests only (6 tests)
npm run test:smoke
```

### Run by Test Type (Headless)

```bash
# Happy Path tests only (63 tests)
npm run test:happy-path

# Edge Case tests only (81 tests)
npm run test:edge-case

# Security tests only (7 tests)
npm run test:security

# API tests only (26 tests)
npm run test:api
```

### Run on Specific Browser

```bash
npm run test:chromium   # Chrome
npm run test:firefox    # Firefox
npm run test:webkit     # Safari
```

---

## Run Tests with Browser Visible (Headed Mode)

### Run by Feature (with Browser)

```bash
# Run ALL Login tests with browser visible
npm run test:login:headed

# Run ALL Cart tests with browser visible
npm run test:cart:headed

# Run ALL E2E tests with browser visible
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run ALL Smoke tests with browser visible
npm run test:smoke:headed
```

### Run by Test Suite Type (with Browser)

```bash
# Run ALL Happy Path tests with browser visible
npm run test:happy-path:headed

# Run ALL Edge Case tests with browser visible
npm run test:edge-case:headed

# Run ALL Security tests with browser visible
npm run test:security:headed
```

### Run ALL Tests with Browser

```bash
# Run everything with browser visible
npm run test:headed
```

---

## Run Specific Scenario (with Browser)

To run a single test scenario with the browser visible:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate tests from feature files (required once)
npm run bddgen

# Step 2: Run specific scenario by name
npx playwright test -g "Scenario Name" --headed --project=chromium --workers=1
remember that scenario name is taken from ~/feature/*.feature files 
```

### Examples

```bash
# Run specific login test
npm run bddgen
npx playwright test -g "Successful login with valid credentials" --headed --project=chromium --workers=1

# Run specific cart test
npm run bddgen
npx playwright test -g "Add a single product to the cart" --headed --project=chromium --workers=1

# Run specific E2E test
npm run bddgen
npx playwright test -g "Complete purchase as a logged-in user" --headed --project=chromium --workers=1
```

### One-liner command

```bash
npm run bddgen ; npx playwright test -g "Add a single product to the cart" --headed --project=chromium --workers=1
```

---

## Debug Mode

```bash
# Debug with Playwright Inspector (step-by-step)
npm run test:debug

# Interactive UI Mode (best for debugging)
npx playwright test --ui
```

---

## View Test Reports

```bash
# Open HTML report after test run
npm run report

# Reports are saved in: reports/html-report/
```

---

## Clean Up

```bash
# Remove generated reports and test artifacts
npm run clean
```

---

## Architecture

### Page Object Model

```
BasePage (abstract)
├── HomePage      - Product grid, categories
├── LoginPage     - Login/Signup modals
├── ProductPage   - Product details, Add to cart
└── CartPage      - Cart items, Checkout flow

Components:
├── HeaderComponent - Navigation links
└── ModalComponent  - Modal dialog handler
```

### BDD Layer

```
features/*.feature     - Gherkin scenarios
       |
steps/*.steps.ts       - Step definitions
       |
src/pages/*.ts         - Page Objects
       |
Playwright API         - Browser automation
```

---

## Environment Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BASE_URL` | `https://www.demoblaze.com` | Application URL |
| `API_URL` | `https://api.demoblaze.com` | API URL |
| `HEADLESS` | `true` | Run headless mode |
| `TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Default timeout (ms) |
